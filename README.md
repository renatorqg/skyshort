The objective is to analyze the results of image features like (lines, blobs, corners, etc) in varius saliency context.

To do that, the first task is to implement some functions for example the features of [Itti's](http://ilab.usc.edu/publications/doc/Itti_etal98pami.pdf) and [Belongie's](http://www.rod.goodman.name/pdf/RG.Paper.CP66.pdf) papers.
